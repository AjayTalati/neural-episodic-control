# Neural Episodic Control

Implementation of something related to
[Neural Episodic Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01988.pdf)
in Tensorflow.

At least, in theory. In practice, I would rather explore LSH based dictionary
architectures for the nearest neighbour lookups, because implementing some kind
of tree-based nearest neighbour in tensorflow is not going to be pretty.
